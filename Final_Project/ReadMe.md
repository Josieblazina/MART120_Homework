For my final project I am wanting to create a generative art piece inspired by Vincent van Gogh's distinctive style. The artwork will utilize p5.js to create a dynamic canvas where particles form swirling patterns reminiscent of Van Gogh's iconic brushwork, particularly those found in "The Starry Night."
    I want the piece to be interactive allowing users influence the flow field with mouse movements, create burts of new particles with clicks and even potentially create music or be interactive with music.
    As I stated earlier, this idea of swirling patterns and contrast is mainly influenced by Van Gogh's Starry night, however I want to take his original idea of a stationary painting with movement and create a generative piece that is an interactive and ongoing version of the painting. 
    I am not completely dead set on what I want the outcome to look like whether it be a recreation of this work or an inspiration based on its properties but I do know that I want to expirement with generative and random movement instead of stationary traditional art seen throughout history, while still using it's key techniques.
Some issues I may run into are...
    Brushstroke authenticity - Making the particles appear as a painting will take somee refining to mimic this technique, along with more varied strokes.
    Advanced Flow Field techniques - this much dimension will be hard to acheive without learning more complex strategies also including the use of shaders and additions for p5.js
    Functionality - handling large particle counts and keeping the program running fast
Timeline
    Week 1 - Develop concept, research Van Gogh's technique and collect reference, Set up p5.js structure
    Week 2 - Refine particle system and brushstrokes, work with flow field algorithms and color palette selection, and develope controls and parameters for performance optimization
    Week 3 - Implement outside source integration for better preformance, user testing, and complete documentation and submission.
Work I've Done
    To get to this final concept I have done a lot of testing and researching of different kinds of generative art to see what I am most interested and inspired by. Now that I have tested some ideas I feel the most confident to build off of this one!
